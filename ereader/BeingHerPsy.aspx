            <h1> Chapter 1 </h1>
            <p class="content"> <pre>Annie looks into the mirror, finally feeling good of herself as if she is the prettiest of all today. It has been a while since she last wore something bright or other than black. The most 'colorful' dress she could be seen wearing for the past 10 months would be either white or gray. The thing was that, her dark clouds had made her closet go in all shades of gray and anyone would know that she'll never wear anything other than those colors.
But last night, she piled up all her courage to throw away most of her modest black and white clothes and just left some of them for the exclusive days. Her father helped recollect some of her old dresses that she used to wear before she got depressed from the attic. To add into her new 'spring' collection, her father gave her some of her late mother's floral dresses for her to get along with.
Last night, throwing away those things was equal to deleting half of her live. It's like erasing a chapter of a book. But then it didn't felt wrong or hard. It felt good and as if she finally can see rainbows in her skies. Her father's smile being the brightest Sun she'd ever seen once he knew that he regained his only daughter back.
Annie looks into the mirror and makes a final edit to her look for the day. The green floral dress with pink and yellow flower scattered randomly on it is complemented by the bright green ribbon just above the waist. Her neck-long black silky hair is let down on her back, it was freshly layered two days ago and is dressed with a plain white broad plastic scarf. All is well. All that's left is to pick a shoe to go with it and that dark blue leather backpack that she has always loved once.
"Annie, are we ready?" Mr Miller suddenly shows up from the white wooden door of Annie's bedroom. He looks fine in a black slack pants and a white shirt designed with light blue stripes. He's always been the one who's not fond of wearing neckties, but there is a gray one in his hands. Just plain silk, looks expensive enough to make a man charming. It's merely because Annie likes to put on tie and she can do it very neat and well. Since Annie lost herself, Mr Miller hadn't worn any ties too.
Annie takes one last look in the mirror and for once she feels like she looks very different. Finally in something other than black or white, seeing her face lighten up along with the vibes given by the color of her dress. She says, "I guess so. Do I look good?"
"Better than ever. Now, would you like to have the honor?" Mr Miller continues as he hands the tie to Annie. Annie smiles, takes the tie and start donning it to her father. He has been the vertebrae of her when all limbs are ripped open from her body.
"Daddy, what if..."
"The what ifs have took you away from me, Annie. Regardless of what people are thinking about you, things are always better when you don't think about it." He comforted her.
A few months back, before Mr Miller decided to admit Annie to a rehab, all answers to his questions about what made her became so stressed out with life were all the what ifs. All of those were the scenarios she's been building up in her head and contributes more to the weakness of her appearance.
She is average. She has fair skin, just the right amount of pale which is in contrast of her pure black hair. Her eyes are in the usual brown you see on most people's face. Her nose, not the kind that American's usually has. It's not sharp nor pointed but it's slightly pressed. She has mild acne problem but it really doesn't account to much of her looks. She's actually very pretty. There were guys who likes her. One point up for her is that because she is damn smart. She is the kind of girl who talks like she's a wikipedia and she notes things down like a typewriter. Her brain, almost as precise as a calculator although she might go tortoise when it comes to maths but still, her answers are 90% similar to the scheme. What else? The science subjects are all her favorite. She could explain to you about the momentum and the blood flow in the body and finally conclude them altogether to prove that science is real. She debates, because she knows facts and she's very good at convincing. She's all valedictorian.
She's all the teachers want to see in a student, she's all the companies want to call a scholar and she's all the parents want to be proud of. Yet in the days where looks are all people see, she became anxious. She never had the feelings of butterflies in the stomach because no guy had ever approached her. She was never asked to go on a 'real' date and her one and only ex-boyfriend dumped her. She thinks that people doesn't prefer her because she is not attractive enough and she's not who's someone proud to become a boyfriend to. She felt like an outcast.
She felt like an outcast when she was never out of any leagues. She distant herself and thought that people dislikes her because of so many 'what ifs' scenarios. She let herself drown. She was the one who let people downgrade her and later opened a room for people to bully her.
"It is a new book, Annie. The old one, I got rid of it. You are the best. Nothing is wrong with you." Mr Miller walks into the room, pats on Annie's back and walk her nearer to the side of the back. Mr Miller helps Annie sit to let her calm herself.
"It's going to be something new to me, Daddy." Annie says. "I hope this time I believe in myself more. I don't want to be like how I was before. I was terrible. I want to be positive. I want to be good."
"You have always been good, Annie. One thing that happened was a lesson for all of us. I believe in you." Mr Miller continues to comfort her daughter.
Annie takes a few breath to calm herself down, "yeah! I am good! Let's go. Have to be early and make a good impression." Annie says in a tone that convinces her father that everything will be alright throughout the day. But she really means it, she's going to start living a new life and mend what needs fixing. She's going to step into that school and fit in into the new environment she's going to live for another two academic years. She's aiming for the best, but this time, it's not for anyone or anything else but her.
Mr Miller grins because for once, he knows that his daughter is beginning to revive herself. He had seen her daughter letting go a fun summer vacation just to spend her days in rehab with a therapist. While the other kids are letting go of themselves, bringing out their inner teenage spirit with their peers, he had to send and fetch Annie every day to see a doctor that promises to help Annie become Annie again. As a father, it was a harsh situation for him, to see his daughter being aided by a stranger in pursuit of finding herself.
As hurting as seeing her young teenage daughter visiting the rehab as her second home, it's more horrifying to see your daughter crying in the bathroom, with her knees pulled up to the chest and the water that went off the drain was blood from her intended cuts. The wounds that he had to see from her daughter's pale skin was the last thing that he want to ever witness yet it happened. He put the blame all on himself-- of letting her daughter self-harm. He promised, he won't ever let that happen again.
"You're ready?" Mr Miller breaks the silence.
"Yeah, I am. But Daddy, can I drive today?" Annie says, making a face as if driving to school today is the only thing that she wants.
"The keys are on the table." Mr Miller answers her while tilting his head slightly to the direction of the island at the kitchen.
"Yay! Thank you, Daddy!" Annie replies Mr Miller with a warm hug and a kiss on the cheek. Mr Miller smiles, the Annie that he is looking at today, is all the Annie that he ever wants to see.
Annie puts on her black flat shoes, the one that has always been her favorite (and her most-worn pair of shoes ever) and fetches her schoolbag from the back of her door. She then excitedly climbs down the staircase to get to the car. She is ready for the day. Before reaching for the doorknob, she stands before it, takes a very deep breath and smiles. She says to herself; 'I will live a great life today!'
Behind the door is Stephen. A long-lost friend who has moved from their old city to this town a few years back. A friend who was close to Annie when they were little peanuts playing in the sandbox. A friend who has never missed an update about her that he could appear at the doorstep today, to welcome Annie to his home sweet home.
Fixing the placement of his dark blue flannel on his well-and-skinny torso while taking a few small static steps to keep himself together, he lets out a sigh. It's been a very long time. The Annie that he knew was only 12 years young and now she's 16. Must be very different and awkward for both of them after 4 years.
At the moment Annie turns the doorknob, Stephen is ringing the doorbell. Annie stunted, yet she proceeds to open the door as her heart tells her that it's someone she wants to see. She opens the door, wide, in awe.
She has to look up to the man who is about 6 feet tall. And she knows that she can recall the face of the man with the brown hair because he is standing just exactly the same way as he was on the day when he bid farewell; with his hands in his jeans' pockets.
And he says, "hi."</pre>

            <br><br>

            <h1> Chapter 2 </h1>
            <p class="content">
                <pre>..."Emm, hi." Annie responds to Stephen's greeting.
                While standing in front of a friend who she hadn't seen for the past four years, a lot of thoughts is being played in her mind. Her brain starts to reverse to the few years back to the days where she and Stephen would always see each other after school, grab some hotdog and just watch the business of life in the city. They weren't best friends and neither of them would claim to be each other's special friend or anything as such but they had been holding each other's back for so long.
                Suddenly Annie's eyes starts to pour out drops of tears, slowly running on her plump cheeks. She's seeing the image of the day when Stephen had to say goodbye because he had to follow his mother who was transferred here, in Chicago. Only in the moment Annie realized that Stephen really meant something for her and losing a place to confess everything that's been clouding up her mind is emotionally painful.
                "Hey, are you okay? I'm sorry I don't mean to..." Stephen says as he sees the tears falling down Annie's face.
                "No, I'm fine. To be exact, I'm excited. I mean, oh my god it has been a while, isn't it? What a pleasant surprise!" Annie replied, wiping her tears with her fingers and smiling in awe.
                "I know it's so sudden and creepy but I heard you moved here and you're supposed to attend your first day of school today. Well, I'm heading that way too." Stephen explains briefly of the reason why he's here.
                "You want to drive me to school?" Annie asks while looking around, curious of not seeing any cars parked in her house compound.
                "Annie, are we going now?" Suddenly, the voice of Mr Miller is heard from behind the door, slowly approaching both of them.
                "Oh, I wasn't expecting a guest. John. John Miller, Annie's father." As Mr Miller gets to the door, he puts out his hands to shake with Stephen and introduces himself.
                "I know you, Mr Miller. I'm Stephen. I was an old friend. It's nice meeting you." Stephen says as he reaches out for Mr Miller for a handshake.
                "I'm sorry, my oldness made it hard to recall. But anyways, nice to meet you too, Stephen. Do you need a ride?"
                "No, um, actually I want to walk Annie to school. There is a bus stop nearby and we usually get to school by it. Only if you don't mind." Stephen declines Mr Miller's invitation nicely as he intended to introduce Annie to the way around town.
                "Well darling, that's actually a good idea. I'll not always be available to send and fetch you from school you know. It will be such a convenience for you and umm, for me. Just in case." Mr Miller agrees to Stephen's idea of Annie getting her own ride to school. Well at least she knows of it in case he wouldn't be able to 'chauffeur' her.
                "The daddies and the in cases. Haha, sure do, Daddy. I'm enlightened to walk with Stephen. Just if it's necessary to be cool sometimes, I'll have the car. Just in case." Annie answers to the suggestion while laughing as she jokes around about having the car when necessary.
                "Hahaha, sure do. Anytime you need to be cool, just 'holla' me okay." All of them giggles to the light comedy happening.
                "Okay, I guess you'd better not be late, Annie. It's your first day. Stephen, I believe you're not attempting to do anything harmful to my daughter... right?"
                "Yeah, I promise with my whole life that I won't hurt her." Stephen replies, sounding something in between joking and serious.
                "No worries, dad. He's a friend." Annie confirmed the safety.
                Mr Miller takes a concerning look at his daughter, but deep inside he has to admit that he knows Stephen, and he has a reason to believe in him.
                "Till then, Daddy." Annie says her last words of the morning to Mr Miller and kisses him on the cheek. Then she walks along to the trails of Stephen who has been walking a few steps ahead after giving a warm smiling gesture to Mr Miller.
                Annie speed up a few steps to keep walking on the same pace as Stephen. Once they're walking side by side, none of them actually starts a conversation. The words in Annie's mind been waiting to be said but she's afraid if she jumped on the wrong spot. She peeks a look at Stephen's face. His hands is still deep in his pockets as if it is his warm spot.
                On the other hand, Stephen too is thinking of a way to crack the awkwardness residing between them. He is actually nervous that he can feel his hands shaking thus putting it in his pockets as if the pockets are his safe haven.
                "Don't you have anything to say to me?" Finally, Annie figures out that if she doesn't say anything, it will be more awkward.
                "Umm, well, I actually kinda missed you."
                "I do too. It's been a while. I expected you to be this tall but not this handsome though. Back then, you were so 'sloppy'." Annie continues telling Stephen what she remembers from the days when they were still talking to each other.
                "Well to be honest, I did stalked you. So, I wasn't surprised to see you today. But it has been very overwhelming because I thought I wasn't brave enough to actually walk with you today." Stephen keeps the conversation going as he blushes a little bit while admitting that he has been updating himself of news about Annie.
                "Wow that's kinda creepy but I thought it's sweet. By the way, how do you know that I live here?"
                "By stalking. I spent my after school hours trying to find your house. Well, I have been considering to visit you a few times already. Just today I had the courage too. I thought if I could be friends with you again, it'll be worth the while." Stephen explains. As they arrive at the bus stop, they don't have to wait longer for the bus to arrive. Their luck.
                On the way, they are exchanging stories of each other. Annie told some things that happened back then when she was still in the city. Being admitted as an old friend, Annie still find herself unable to trust Stephen on her depression stories. People changes so she's scared that Stephen might not be the one that she once knew.
                Upon arrival, both of them leaves the bus together. As they step off of the bus, Stephen pulls out a cigarette box from his right pocket and a lighter. As he placed one in between his white teeth, he lit it up.
                "You smoke?" Annie questions Stephen's actions.
                "Well, I am 16 now."
                "Well, who says that a 16-year-old should smoke?"
                "Nobody says I should, but we always could."
                With that said, Annie lets out a sigh as if she is disappointed to know that Stephen smokes. Annie has something against smokers. She thought that smokers kills not only themselves but the other people surrounding too. By looking at Stephen's smoking, she's aware of the changes that might have been biting Stephen down.
                "What, you don't like I smoke?" Stephen asks while taking a glance at Annie who displays a disgusted look.
                He inhales a big smoke as the finale of the session and he throws the cigarette to the ground, stepping it with his washed-off gray Converse.
                "Then I'll stop."
                "Seriously?" Annie asks, overwhelmed by the thought of someone stop risking their life because of her.
                "Well for now, I'll stop smoking around you. The rest, I'll figure it out." Stephen replies. Annie goes back to the phase of disappointment. Stephen walks faster ahead of her, leaving her a few steps behind but this time, she's not keeping up the pace.
                At the moment, a lot is coming to her mind. How long is 4 years to change someone into a person who acts so much different than who they were? What causes too much changes in someone and why are they becoming people that is not who they were?
                What happened to Stephen?
                What Annie knows about the history of Stephen's family makes she realizes that watching him smoke is a sad thing. His dad died of lung cancer because he's a smoker. Stephen used to whine about how he misses his dad to her and she remembers that he used to promise that he won't ever smoke because he doesn't want to risk anyone's life.
                She only laid out the very obvious 'you smoke' question to get an honest answer of why, he objects his own notion of never being a smoker.
                "Annie, aren't you walking with me?" Annie's thoughts are distracted by Stephen's voice from far ahead of her. He's already at the school's entrance while she's blocking walking people in the middle of the enormous school ground.
                Realizing that she is not in motion, Annie runs slowly to reach out to Stephen. At the door, Stephen is waiting for Annie with his hand hold out for her to reach. He's smiling, broadly and everyone who sees him at the moment will think that he's being awfully romantic with the gesture of wanting to hold a girlfriend's hand. But inside, only he knows how upset he's being, guessing what Annie could've been thinking about him. There's just too much to tell and he's just waiting for the right time to tell Annie things. That's one reason of why he approaches her. He wants a safe have, like how he used to have her as a company back in the days.
                As Annie arrives at the entrance, she is panting of slow-running from afar. Her hands are flipped up and down like a paper fan to wind the sweat away. Stephen pulls out a handkerchief from his another pocket, "here, seems like you need it."
                Annie refuses to accept his handkerchief and she looks at his face, wanting to confirm whether it's something true, or not. Yet she doesn't even sure of the answers that she's been looking for. Time flies so Stephen decides that he'll wipe the droplets from Annie's cheeks and he can see that she blushes. Annie is stunted by the gesture. She can't quite comprehend the possible reasons of why Stephen had to act like that. They aren't lovers, and they only meta few minutes back after a long, exhausting four years-- for both of them.
                Then they burst into laughter. The sound of their laughters combined is so melodious to Annie's ears as if they are living 4 years behind today. The kind of laughter that had been her favorite sound after a long day for every single day before is heard again after a long time. Stephen puts his hands on Annie's cold shoulder, and Annie wraps her short, petite hands on Stephen's waist. Their walks become synchronized effortlessly as their body sways in the rhythm of love. For each second, their body moves like trees dancing by the swaying wind, taking turns and each pulse connects them with each other. The laughter goes on and on, stops for a few seconds and continues to the next as if the air around them is filled with a laughing gas. If it isn't because of the ringing bells, signaling the start of class, they might did not stop laughing at all.
                "Well, I guess we've had enough. I had to rush to class." Stephen speaks while his jaw is still exhausted of persistent laughing. He takes a deep breath and is ready for his first class. He kisses Annie's forehead, and later, walks away even before Annie gets to say anything...</pre>

            <br><br>

            <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
            <p class="content">
                <pre>...Annie is stunted. What was it just now? A kiss upon the cheek from someone who she hadn't seen for 4 years— from someone who she might not know anymore. The fact that he just did that made Annie wonders about his intentions. What was it for? Is it something meaningful or the people around here kisses everyone around on the cheek as a friendly gesture?
                The second bell rings to mark the time where everyone should be in their respective classes by now. Annie wakes up from her sudden 30 seconds dream and realizes that she's late. She's supposed to be in the principal's office to report her admission. She walks along the hallway, just in the right speed so that she wouldn't have to keep the principal waiting. The hallway is almost empty from students all rushing to their classes. She's joining one of them soon, after she gets her schedule from the office.
                Just a few steps later she finds herself standing at the student's center before she pushes the clear glass door and steps inside. She inhales and everyone in the room warmly smiles to her. The girl in very decent pink skirt and white blouse having her blond hair in bun behind the very first counter greets her, "hi, how may I help you?"
                Annie approaches the counter while taking out her documents from her bag. She lets out a small cough, "hi, I'm a new student. I'm supposed to report my admission to the principal today."
                The girl over the counter smiles and while, Annie's eyes runs over the name tag she's wearing; Sarah. She looks like a 'Sarah', she thought.
                "Mr Adams will see you soon." Sarah, the girl behind the counter says to Annie. "Have a seat, treat yourself for a light coffee at the pantry."
                Annie nods, and just as she's about to walk to the sofa at the other side of the room, Sarah approaches her, "Annie Miller?"
                As she heard Sarah's voice from behind calling her name, she turns around and replies, "yes?"
                "Mr Adams will see you now. This way, please." Sarah continues as she holds her hand, gesturing the way for Annie to head to the principal's office.
                "Okay, thank you."
                Annie continues to walk to the principal's office. Mr Adams, her principal can be seen through the glass door, currently preparing some sheets which most probably contains her personal details for the school's administration to keep. While she was about to reach for the door's handle, Mr Adams moves his head up from the files on his mahogany desk and smiles to see Annie from behind the door. He smiles, straightly stands up from his black leather office chair and walks towards the door. He welcomes Annie.
                "Miss Miller? Please, come in." Mr Adams says as he opens the door for Annie. Annie steps inside, amazed by the interior design of the office. It looks so sophisticated with the book cabinet hanging just at right place to reach once you've seated on the leather seat. There is a Van Gogh painting somewhere on the east side of the room. She looks around, feeling delighted of the wonderful set of the office.
                "Please, have a seat, Miss Miller."
                Annie takes a seat. The guest's chairs are also wrapped in expensive leather. For her, the room looks more of a businessman's office rather than a principal's.
                "Welcome to Lincoln High. We are so glad to have you here. Your father and I were good friends. How are you doing...?" Mr Miller starts the conversation and left the question hanging as he failed to recognize Annie's name.
                "Anastasia. Anastasia Miller. I'm doing good, and dad's fine too." Annie replies to Mr Miller.
                "Good to know. Where are you residing?" Mr Miller continues to converse with Annie while he's flipping the pages of Annie's student file and writing some notes on some pages on it.
                "Down the Lilac Street. Our house are just a few blocks away from the diner."
                "That's a nice neighborhood. Here is your schedule and I've attached it with the list of clubs that you can join. Just come to the student's center if you want to register. We're open anytime during the office hours so just feel free to pay a visit. The counselor's office is just beside mine."</pre>
