There are times when the bus doesn't come on time,
And left you waiting in the coldest night,
Those times when even the naked eyes,
Could capture the demons passing by,
But that's not the reason why your cheeks became cold,
That's not why the tears showers the lashes,
You just see a movie playing in your mind,
About the pasts that haunts your nights,
The mistakes that mouths make sounds,
The heartbreaks that never seem to heal,
You became so fragile, and the waterfall became so active,
Just by one blow of the cold air,
You could stumble down,
And now you're seeing the world performed on your retina,
In bokeh,
From the lens of your naked eyes...

The small mind,
That can't solve algebra,
That can't explain science,
Almost drown the body that owns it,
With the thoughts of the world,
That seems never stop filling up the pool of ideas,
Sooner controls the emotions,
Controls the way of thinking,
Showing world in another perspective,
Shuts his mouth,
Building a universe inside it,
Raining new thoughts of every single phenomenon,
Records tragedies and sins,
You'll be surprised to know,
That the small mind could kill,
If you try to read what it keeps,
Until you believe that it's actually,
The biggest mind you'll ever know...

                <PRE>
I believed that even a second could be the most influential moment,
Once it pays a visit to your memory lane,
You could break til the last piece of your soul,
Or it could make you smile as wide as the ocean,
Compare it to the week that we spent together,
The best week of my life,
Where we laugh over the same jokes,
We speak over the same ideas,
When my eyes naughtily stole a second from your clock,
To take a glance of you, and capture you safely in my mind,
And in the mirror it reflects the moments,
When you thought I could not see you trying to watch me,
I could not read minds and I could not make assumptions,
My guesses are not really accurate at times,
And you too could never have the answer the room has,
Because only the room witnessed everything.

            <p class="content">
                <PRE>
Let's make it to the end of your collection of sleepless nights sighs,
It's countless – how much have you suffered heartache,
It's weird how you could ignore counting your blessings,
Shut your eyes of the world for a while,
Let your mind saunter around effortlessly to the place you've never been,
Escape from the cage the world has kept you in,
Shut your eyes,
Erase everything from your mind for a little while,
Then call the memories back, gather them around in place,
Recall the painful times you had to let your heart bleed out,
Think about the times when you could smile brighter than the full moon,
Stop the hands of the words from stabbing your heart,
Just think.
Think of everything that hurts you the most,
To the things that put you at the highest peak of the earth,
Pour down the innocent tears,
Let them escape your pool of magnificent lenses,
Pour the water into a glass of hope,
Pour everything out,
Then seal the new pages of air you're sucking in your lungs,
Draw a new face on the first sheet,
Whisper to the wind – you want to live brand new,
Leave the glass on the table, find a new dining room,
Feed in the happiness you could find in the thin air,
Start a new chapter of the book, serve yourself a bowl of stars,
Leave the society,
Take a bow, for a new book you're publishing,
For the world to see your awakening...

            <p class="content">
                <PRE>
Everyone is made to fancy this beautiful planet,
Even flowers are meant to scent the earth,
But non of the fancies meant to have immortal life,
And I'm only wondering if I'm not meant for tomorrow,
If I'm not meant for tomorrow,
This poem will outshine me when I'm deceased,
It will turn out as an eulogy read by someone who wills,
It will be an announcement to the guests at my funeral,
A speech of freedom from the sickening of living in the human skin,
A sheet of answers to every question of living in calamity,
A conclusion to why the lungs chose to inhale until only this moment,
A confession of a person who sucks at being fancy.
If I'm not meant for tomorrow,
I hope the forgiveness are all coming in my way,
The hatred burns in place and the ashes turns to love for me,
The mistakes become jokes that we could laugh and learn about,
The apologies are all accepted and no fights shall happen in souls of the enemies.
If I'm not meant for tomorrow,
Know that I'm crying over the things that I didn't make it to it's places,
Over the words that got caught in my fortress,
That didn't make it's way out to the ears that they should tell,
Over the life that I didn't live out,
That is dull and blank without histories,
Over the chances that I let go,
That shall create stories to be proud of,
Over the ages of sins I've collected,
That didn't make it's way to my planned repents.
If I'm not meant for tomorrow,
There'd be one less creature,
To fancy someone's world,
When he realizes that he just let the chances of spilling the drink,
Is not going to serve a place for him anymore.

                <PRE>
Is it world's fault to blame if the humans are being too cruel?
Because heartaches is now a common disease,
I would blame the people who seldom sees the calmness behind disasters,
The people who forgets the pure beauty
When they're blinded with drawings on pretty faces,
Blinded with the new way of pricing prides – the printed papers to pay starbucks,
They forgot to see the blue sky that's prettier than barbies,
Ignored the green grass that's more lovely than the beauty pageants,
Did not see the gracious dancing butterfly over problems lingering in their haunted minds,
Didn't spend the time to count the sparkling stars over deceiving bucks,
Shuts their stressful eyes over the beautiful shining sun,
Hides in their shelters from the wind that pushes them into reality,
The air that pushes them off the cliff,
To make them see the positive in negative beliefs they're holding on,
Declined the invitation to sit on the bench, smelling roses,
Over buzzing over the gossips that won't feed their hunger,
They've found what they're looking for, just didn't spend time to believe,
Because the beauty of the nature is seldom seen.

There's never the time when I can see,
If there is someone at my window,
Because my blinds are never folded up.
There's never the time that I can taste the syrup,
Diffused in my glass full of plain water,
Because my taste buds are arrogant.
There's never the time when I could listen,
A man's footsteps when it's coming my way,
Because I listen to Mayday Parade way too much.
There's never the time when I could feel,
If the flowers in my garden are blooming,
Because the butterflies are dancing in my tummy.
There's never the time that I could say,
If my heart has found it's complement,
Because I never see you diffuse into my veins.
There's never the time that I could describe,
How pretty is the crimson love,
Or how lovely is velvet to violets,
Because I never see it with my eyes.
There's never the time that I could tell,
If I have fell into your edges,
Because I could not feel your get into my lungs.
But there's time where I believe,
That I will see,
The diffusion of your honesty in my insecurities.

Dear friend,
How are you doing?
Do you still have the slightest sound of bells ringing about me?
Do you still smell the lightest scent of vanilla I wear?
Do you still hear me singing a broken symphony that I always hum?
Or you can't even picture who's this dust among crystals you're seeing...
I'm afraid I'm no longer residing in your mind,
Because I never got the moving notice.
Tell me, have you seen the flowers that you always wanted to see?
That you've never get the chance to do it with me.
Have you heard the music inside your soul you're finding?
That you've never get the chance to sing with me.
Have you found the novel you're dreaming of being the hero?
That you've never get the chance to write with me.
Tell me, if we're still on the same page?
Or you've turned forward for the ending...
How are you doing?
I hope I am still a statue of infinity,
In your city of liberty.
How are you doing?
I hope you're no longer fighting.
You've fought enough, now's time to rest.
In peace, my little friend.
Almost a hero, always a saviour.
I'm doing fine.
I'll always question – how are you doing?
I will never be stop looking for the answer.

If one little fabulous rose could leave scars on your flawless skin,
Why can't life left you with a packet of disasters?
If one handsome creature could leave your heart unhealed,
Why can't life left you with a bottle of adventures?
If one little society could leave you buried alive below grounds,
Why can't life offer you a killing road?
As you walk along the killing road,
Everything you want starts with a burning desire,
Everything you tries ended up wrong,
Everything you make seems never right.
Shower in the flame, little lady.
Let it fuel your desires up to the hottest flame, mister.
Burn up your wishes and hopes, let the smoke lift it up to the sky, pretty girl.
Kill the killing road and walk with pride, my monsters.

I am too young to be trusted that I could keep myself.
That's why I never watch the stars straight above my head.
I've always wanted to lie on the grass in the meadow,
And let the moon shine on my shadow.
I could use a brown, comforting blanket,
If the cold is terrifying my skin.
I am not in my twenties yet to be let go, travelling the globe.
That's why I never watched the story of dandelions.
I've always wanted to see they go their own way,
And grow as a beauty pageant alone,
Attracts me to being an independent human,
I could use mother dandelion,
If the life isn't teaching me well enough.
One day,
I'll be in South Carolina.
I'll see behind my spectacles,
The beauty of the flying petals of dandelions,
In my brown old blanket,
On a high beige stool,
From the window of a chapel,
Listening to 'ships',
Leaving the rest of the world behind,
With a little help
Of blankets and dandelions.
