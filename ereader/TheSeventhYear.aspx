YEAR ONE.
A high-school reunion.
"Hi, Skylar. Thought you'd never come back." I hear an annoying voice like a plastic-trash-swiped-away-by-autumn-wind speaking from my back. As soon as I see a flinch of her blonde pulled-up hair walking beside me, I already know, I'll be damned.
I smile to her words because I knew that all she wanted to do was to make me feel as bad as possible and of course, her never-ending hobby, to bring out the most moronic side of me.
"How have you been doing lately?" She asks me, probably wanting to start a conversation that would lead to me killing her using a butter knife.
"I'm going to get some more sangria." I say to her, trying to push her off before my bomb exploded. I whip my salon-made curled blue ombre hair. I chuckle as I stood up to walk away as the flashback starts before me. I remember a few years ago when she tried to dye her hair ombre herself because she 'graduated' from a styling class during summer break. I didn't know what actually happened but she came to school wearing a beanie for a whole week and her best friend said that she got her hair all damaged. It was only a week later that her parents decided to pay for her hair treatment and as for that decision be made late, none of us had any idea why.
But the thing is, it feels so good to wave such a pretty and healthy hair to her face.
"Oh, come on, Skylar! We haven't talked for at least a year. Don't you have anything to ask me?" She asks. When she uttered that question, I know that something will go wrong in just seconds. I glare at the butter knife with a passion of murdering burning in my soul. In any time, for one more word she let out, I am ready to be jailed for life.
"I'd rather die than hearing anything coming out of your mouth, Sasha. Save your story for someone else." I reply as I set my mind, I need to walk away.
I've heard of a news that she made out with my ex, Nate for a year now. What's best of her is that she got Nate just a few months after our engagement pulled off because of some misunderstandings. Sasha knows it all too well of how much I loved Nate and we have been together for five years before we decided to finally get attached. A month away from our wedding date and he started to lose interest in me. I heard that he was cheating on me with some random girl but ended up dating Sasha not long after.
"You must have known it already then. We're getting engaged soon." She continues even if she sees me walking away. My ears are all red and my heart is burning charcoals as I was ready to fire her but instead, I swipe off my anger away and decided to move on. I am already twenty-five, there's no point of acting irrationally over a guy that was a part of my horrible past.
I left Sasha for a drink counter and asked the barista for a sangria.
"Listen, Nick," I speak out his name as I read on his black name tag put on his left chest of his vest, "If that blonde dumb over there come over for a drink, give her a poisoned one." I say to him and he chuckles.
"That much hatred? I can't imagine what she'd done to you." He replies with a sweet grin on his face. As I smirk and throw a raging stare towards her, I replied, "Oh, you have no freaking idea."
I say as I left the bar.
I wander across the ballroom with not an idea of to whom I should start a conversation with. People greeted me 'hi' along the way but I didn't feel like talking to them so I just 'hi-ed' them back. Everything I felt was a deep pit of despair as my mind sauntered back to the moment when I figured out that Nate has been cheating on me. We had awesome years and amazing plans for our wedding. We booked a chapel and got a perfect humorous ministry to tie a knot together. He could have said it earlier to me that he didn't have a thing for me anymore but he chose to wait for confirmation instead. As dumb as he might be, he needed his feelings to be validated by dating with someone who he described to be better in most ways than me. And that was when my wedding gown was already picked up.
It took time for me to get over him so I shut my twitter account just to get rid of any conversation about him living in my timeline. Because we've been together for years, his friends became mine and my friends became his. For whatever they tweeted, something about him popped up into my feed and I could not stand it.
For the last few months, my friends in high school started gossiping about how Nate is currently dating Sasha, I feel horrible. It's surely not because I'm haunted by the memories of us together, but it's the fact that he threw me away like a broken poem made me sour. He didn't even notice of how much of my self-esteem had been knocked down by his choice of performance. I was sad that they reminded me of the time when I was treated like a final choice.
"Skylar! How are you doing now?!" I feel a hand pat on my bare shoulder. The hand slowly slide over the velvet silk ribbon wrapping around my right clavicle. I turn around and I see Hannah with a smile on her fair skin. She's still prettily donning long black hair in a mermaid-inspired braid.For what I've remembered about her, she's never changed her hair color since high school. I think that she likes how she looks like with her natural hair color. And she's right about it. With her natural skin fairness and pink lip gloss, she looks so amazing.
"I'm doing fine. How about you?" I reply to her greetings. She's the only one trying to really talk to me in the very room now.
"I think I'm good. How is your shoe business? Is it starting yet or I have to wait much longer to get married?" She says as she let out a small cute giggle. I started designing and making shoes three years ago. The passion for making shoes was brought by my father who was previously a successful cobbler in his younger years. Now, he's retired and farms with my brother and my mother.
"You're getting married?!" I ask her excitedly, even though my shoe business is going strong now and I have already gone almost worldwide, I'm more amused about the topic of Hannah getting married. She nodded and we let out a small intoxicated yell. To hear about your friend getting married is so thrilling!
"Andrew and I, we had a daughter and we have been living together now. He bought a house for us in the suburbs so after a few weeks of discussing and counting dollars, we've decided to get married." Hannah explained.
I've heard about Andrew and Hannah being the only couple who lasts until today and juicy mouths claimed that they had a daughter but as far as I have been following both of them on social medias, I've not seen a picture of her anywhere. But since Hannah said herself, it sure is a fact.
"I've heard about your baby, how is her?" I ask, going all interested in her new life as a young mommy. She let out a delightful smile as if describing her wonderful motherhood journey in a perfect gesture, "her name's Samantha. She's 9 months old and she's so chubby like if you've seen her, you sure want to be her godmother!" And that explains the smile. She's happy.
We proceeded our conversation as Hannah started to slide over Samantha's pictures from her phone and showed them to me. I admit, Hannah and Andrew are almost flawless and their daughter turned out to be as pretty as a princess. She slayed me, and she's only 9 months old. A few talks later, Andrew comes and joins us while he's wrapping his muscular arm around the slim waist of Hannah. I can't believe that she could still own the body of an hourglass and has a daughter!
I had fun talking to them as our group of talkative people grows bigger and bigger with more members joining. Andrew and Hannah being the only steady couples while some friends bring along newcomers, introducing them as their partners. Everything about their life sounded so great and even the saddest stories entertained us. Everyone gave out thoughtful talks and motivations on how life can turn both good and bad simultaneously without a notice.
Everything is so good until, "Hi everyone!" Sasha joins. Everyone greeted her and welcomed her to the group but I am already having sides. Half preparing to be as nice as possible and not to start a tantrum and the other side is ready to burn her down to ashes if she says even the slightest clue about anything Nate and her.
"What did I miss?" She asked, making adorable gestures while smiling around as if she's interested in their stories, but I know, she's offering everyone a little drop of her story.
"A lot! But we're not coming back to you. But we're so happy to hear yours!" Amanda, one of us invited Sasha to start her play. Here comes drama queen.
"Nothing much happened except that I finally found someone that loves me with all his heart and we're getting engaged next week! Everyone is welcomed, I'm going to mail you guys the invitation. But don't forget to wear pink!" Sasha tells everyone in exhilaration. People respond to her news happily and started to shower her with questions regarding 'the man' and some congratulating words. At the moment, I know something was up. My guess appears to be right as soon as she winked at me. For the sake of everyone's prosperity, I'm leaving the group.
I glanced at Sasha as I stand up but her face says, "uh-oh, not so fast, baby." And the crooked smile becomes her fire-starter.
"Okay enough about me," she says as she smiles and continues, "So, Skylar, I heard you're getting married? When is it, if we must know?" Boom. One bomb.
I stutter a few cursing words under my breath. I don't know how to respond. I feel my whole body shakes and I'm holding back tears masked with a smile to everybody. I can see faces of awkwardness, curiosity and guilty. I don't know what to say.
"No, you've heard the wrong thing." That's all the respond I could think of. At the moment, a tear drops from my left eye and I am trying to hold back the rest of the downpour before everything goes wrong.
"Oh really? But my boyfriend claimed to be your acquaintance and he said that you failed your engagement or something? Is it true, I'm so sorry." Sasha continued and I can see the faces turned all surprised. The only person that I'm rooting, for now, is Hannah and her guilty look makes me hoping for her to rescue me now.
"Okay, it's okay. We can skip this talk now. Thank you for asking. Cocktails, anyone?" I heard a guy's voice coming from behind me as he placed his hand on my shoulder while his other hand holding a tray of cocktails. He put the tray on the table we're surrounding and pulled me out of the crowd, "excuse us," he says and smiles.
There is a silence at the table as I leave with broken heart and tears falling down my face like Niagara Falls. The memories of being left by a man I love flashes before me and the more I sniffed to exhale my sadness, the more I feel his hand rubbing my back to comfort me. Under the silence I heard him say, "it's okay, let it out."
My face down, looking at the ground as we walked outside of the hall. A few steps later, the man pushes a door open and we went into a room. He helped me walk a few steps more and sat me down on a metal bench. I wipe my tears with my hands as he handed me a white tie. Feeling odd, I look up to see the man who's bringing me to this rooftop- it's Nick.
"Hi, I was the barista." He tells me as I take a look at him. "I'm sorry I don't have a handkerchief." He continued as he laughs. "Come on, it's just a piece of cloth." He says and finally, I laugh. He wants me to wipe off my tears with his perfectly clean white tie.
"I have mascara..." I mumbled. The only thing that holds me back from wiping my tears with his tie is the fact that I am wearing a mascara.
"It's okay, my shift ended. I don't need it now." He explains yet I'm still hesitating to stain his tie. Did I mention it's silk and it looks expensive? Just a few seconds after, he takes back the tie from my hand and kneeled before me. He takes a look while I become mesmerized by his deep blue eyes. He smiles as he touches my cheek and the other hand wiping my tears away. His tie is now stained with some foundation, concealer, and dots of mascara.
He stood up, rolled his tie back and tucked it into his pocket. He giggles. He let out a big sigh and sat right next to me on the bench.
"Now I see why you hated her so bad." He starts talking to me. "She's pushing it out, didn't she? She knew about it but she needs everyone to know how awful is it to be you right now. She's basically my brother wearing a blonde wig." He adds, and I laugh because it was funny.
"She won him over me." I say. Soon, I feel another stream of tears about to escape from my pool of brown eyes.
"It's okay. It's not like he's all the man existed in this world." Says him.
And both of us keep the moment silent. We have nothing to say.
"You know what, you seriously have to get over him. It's not like you're not going to have a chance with him, but he doesn't deserve you." He suddenly let out some words in a tone that expresses his unsatisfactory towards what had happened.
He stood up, taking a few steps forward to the metal grips at the end of the rooftop and leaned towards it. He then turned around to face me while his back is still on the very metal rod bordering the rooftop, probably to keep us from falling for the tenth-storey building. He says, "you guys have separated and yet you still grieve over him leaving you. While on the other hand, he's already happy with someone else. No matter how bad she could be, he'd chosen her over you. So you have to stand up. And move on." Exactly the thing that I needed to hear now.
"I need to forget him, don't I?" I asked, blatantly.
"Yes." He replied. He moves forward closer to me. "All you need to do is to let yourself have fun a little bit. Tell me how long have you had your sleepless nights, crying over spilled milk, not indulging your favorite chocolates and breathe deeply. Just admit it, you didn't have time for all that because you're putting too much effort on forgetting him while pushing the fact that you just have to ignore it already."
His face is right in front of me and our fingers intertwined. All that he said just now is true. I've not let myself be happy for a long time. I just acted like I do.
Then I let the time passes by, trying to give myself some space to think.
"Do you want to have some burgers? I haven't been eating burgers for quite a long time now." I break out the silence.
"Is it not late for you, now?" He asks. Probably concerns if I have to go to work tomorrow.
"Nope. I just make shoes at my own stall. I guess I could call a day off. I need to procrastinate a little. Next custom shoes only need to be done by next month so I guess a burger night won't hurt."
"Okay then, only at the best burger place in town." He replies as we both grin to the thoughts of wonderfully layered burger amidst the business of New York. He reaches out for my hand and we walk out of the rooftop and reached for the buttons of the elevator. All down to one of the best nights of my life.
Artichoke Basille's Pizza
I don't know what happened but our plans change and instead of biting burgers, we're cutting pizzas in The Artichoke. One fact I learned about Nick is that he doesn't like pizza crusts so as soon as the pizza arrived earlier, he cut off the circumference and put it aside.
"Hey! Why'd you strip down the pizza?" I screamed amidst the buzz of people around us.
"Crusts are so lame and not delicious," He answered.
"No! It's not! You have no right to eat a pizza naked. It's offensive to the chefs!"
"As long as you know how to volume down, we'll be fine." He says and we laugh. Now, we're half away from finishing our pizza.
"What's your most hated topping on this pizza?" Nick asked suddenly, breaking our silence of joy.
"Pineapples."
"And I hate mushrooms."
"No way! Mushrooms cannot be hated! It's cute and nice!"
"Oh come on, there's no way mushrooms can be cuter than me tho." And we laugh. We've already laughed a lot up to this moment.
"So it's like this, we list out puns, and if either one of our puns is not funny enough, we'll eat the toppings we hate." And I nod to his game idea.
And the fun begins as we tell each other funny things we recall from our times of revising the internet. At times, I cheat by looking from my phone under the table because I don't want to lose. As time flies, we exchange laughter until I see a familiar face make his way into the restaurant with another hand intertwined with his. My humor dies as I try to recall all the faces I've seen my whole life.
Nick realizes my distraction and decided to follow my lead. He turns around to the way that I am looking at. But sooner that I thought he would be surprised by the view, he returns to his original position and grips my hand and says, "I know him."
"Oh, how surprising. I know his partner." I reply and from my side, I can see that Nick is confused with what I just uttered.
"Correct me if I'm wrong but is that..." and I cut him off, "yeah. She's gonna eat just what she cooked." Now, it's my turn to smile like a satisfied witch.

                Previously on The Seventh Year Chapter 1:
                Nick realizes my distraction and decided to follow my lead. He turns around to the way that I'm looking at. But sooner that I thought he would be surprised by the view, he returns to his original position and grips my hand and says, "I know him."
                "Oh, how surprising. I know his partner." And my face muscles forces me to smile like the world is finally mine...
                Nick laughs at me. He shakes his head in disbelief. I don't know why but I notice that this situation is so damn hilarious that all we can do is laugh because all the guesses we've made about this guy turns out wrong and the accurate answer is way beyond our expectations.
                "Now I know why she came to the dinner alone. Her boyfriend's cheating on her." I say.
                Nick continues to laugh as if everything that is currently happening is a comedy sitcom, "I don't know what you're talking about but well, his boyfriend is cheating on her with a goddamn football player," he tells me. "That guy, is my brother." He continues as he points to the direction of the guy holding hands with Nate.
                "You remember the harsh blonde?" I ask Nick. I was just about to tell him about Sasha's current boyfriend aka my ex-boyfriend that is currently in a pretty serious affair with his brother before he finally notices it, "Oh my gosh. Don't tell me my brother-in-law is that freaking Nate." Says Nick in surprise. But what else can I do, it's a fact.
                "Yeah, that's Nate." At least, that is all I could say.
                "I am nothing against gay people but Nate? Now it's safe to say that even with over two hundred countries existing in this world, it's still small." Nick continues as we let out a small giggle. After a few sighs and gulps, Nick says, "I'm gonna go buy them a drink," while he's looking at the couple sitting at a table at the right corner of the restaurant.
                "Let's go have supper with them," I reply just because I think it would be fun to show up together. I wonder how Nate will react when he sees me.
                "Are you still hungry? You freaking monster." Nick says sarcastically questioning my intention to have another late-night-eating session with the two lovebirds.
                "Haha! Please stop teasing, let's just get them some fresh juices." I smile as I let my finger slide in between his long narrow fingers. With slight confusion shown on his face, I raised my eyebrows to indicate that it's fun to help a friend mess around with their ex for once in a while.
                I lead the walk to Nate and Nick's brother's table while holding hands with Nick. I try to act naturally as if I haven't realised their existence in the very room.
