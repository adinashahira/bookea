 "I love the portfolio, Miss Higgins. I am really amused by the designs. Then I guess there should be no excuse for me to not have you as a part of the team. Welcome to Candy Couture, Victoria Higgins." Mrs Tracy Clarke pronounced Vic as a new designer for her big fashion brand, Candy Couture. 
Candy Couture has been the most selected elegant and casual fashion center in the big city of New York. Tracy started the business with his ex-husband when they were only 20 because they had a kid, and they have to pay rent for a family. After a few years working in a banking firm, her husband, James Patowsky ran away with another girl and asked for a divorce and moved to London. For the love of her daughter, Tracy proceeded the business and the business has grown bigger by years. Now that she owned a lot of wealth, she was thinking of expanding her business to another level. She wanted to provide a wedding dress service.
Ever since Vic was a small kid, she is fond of designing clothes but never had the chance to produce any. All she could do was design and design on her yellow legal pad. However, she never stopped trying to reach her dream. She is a graduate from Berkeley College in the field of fashion designing. Now that she know how to sew dresses, she sew her own dresses so that she can represent her own brand whenever she wanted to look for jobs.
"Oh my God! Thank you so much Mrs Clarke! I have been dreaming of being a part of the Candy Crew. This is like a dream come true!" Vic replied excitedly to Tracy's approval.
"I am much more excited to have you as the part of the Candy Crew, Miss Higgins. Thank you for coming here and taking the job. I mean, you have literally granted my wish. I have been praying to god so that I could finally provide bridal services. And He sent me you. You are the best among the other candidates who had dropped their portfolios. I believe in you, Miss Higgins." Tracy explain with much enthusiasm. 
"You know what, Mrs Clarke, just call me Vic." 
"I would love that. You're a part of the family now. Please just call me Tracy, I insist. I hope you feel warmed with us here. Just tell me if you need anything. So, I will put you at the bridal section. You'll be starting tomorrow and your cubicle would be the white one. Don't forget to pick up your vest at the front desk. I cannot wait to see you tomorrow." Tracy ended the conversation by shaking her hands with Vic. 
Victoria nodded while turning around, grinning. Walking out of Tracy's office with a big heart knowing that tomorrow, she will be designing for other people, not just herself. Starting from tomorrow, more people will be wearing her designs. And finally, someone trusted her to do what she always love to do.
Vic walked towards the front desk and was greeted warmly by the receptionist, wearing a black dress with the top tucked in neatly by a red vest. On her left chest, put nicely a name tag with her name, Amy written on it. She smiled charmingly while putting a vest in a clear plastic bag on the table for Vic to reach.
"Miss Higgins, this is your vest. You'll be wearing this every day so if you ever need an extra vest, just tell me. It will be ready in a day so make sure you give a notice a day before you want it. Do you prefer to have a magnetic name tag or the basic one?" Said Amy.
"I would like to have the basic name tag. I'm a bit clumsy so I wouldn't be sure if I could keep the magnetic tag for more than a week." Vic said, giggling.
"I totally get that." Amy replied while responding to Vic's small laugh.
"And, could I ask for an extra vest. I mean, it would be easier to have a back-up plan right?"
"Sure. It will be ready tomorrow."
"Thank you so much. See you tomorrow." Vic replied as she thanked Amy with gratitude. 
Vic walked towards the door, about to leave the premise. A few steps ahead, she heard a man's 'ouch' from her left side. She turned aside to look for where the sound came from.
Vic saw a man, fell in front of lamp post and his coffee was spilling all over his white shirt. His briefcase was still in his wounded hands but his phone was thrown a few inches away from where he fell. Vic walked to the man,
"Oh my gosh, are you okay?" Vic helped the man to stand and picked up his phone shortly afterward. His iPhone's screen cracked a little at the upper edge. As the man stood up, Vic can clearly see that his suit was all messed up by the coffee stain. He obviously cannot go to work like that.
"I'm Will. And I'm okay. Thanks." The man named Will said.
"Are you sure? I mean, your hand is scratched quite poorly, and your shirt was all stained. Wasn't the coffee hot? I'm guessing it's burning quite a bit of your skin."
"You're hotter. You're burning me more tho." Will replied, making Vic's fair cheeks go all reddish-pink. He smiled. Vic was shying all over and she turned her look all to the ground below them.
"I suggest we go buy you a band-aid. And, maybe you'll need some time to change. Where are you heading to?" Vic replied to Will after a while, trying to calm down. She had to admit, when a guy compliments you that way, you'll be incoherent. 
"I was supposed to pick up a suit at the Candy's. But Buzzfeed got me stuck to the screen. There were Kardashian's gifs all piled up in one post. It was dead funny I missed the lamp post. And now this happened, I don't know what to do." Will said, and nobody can deny. He looked so handsome, even when his forehead's grown a little bit swell.
"You seriously need to get out of this suit." Vic said, and they burst into laughter.
"I guess I'll go pick it up then."
"I'll be keeping your phone so that you won't miss the door." They both laughed.
"Wait for me here."
Will walked a few steps and entered the Candy's building. Vic looked down at Will's phone, the wallpaper was a portrait of Mona Lisa. For Vic, it was something strange. A man? Mona Lisa? As she let her mind wanders around a cloud of thoughts about Will, a hand poked on her bare shoulder.
"Miss me?" Will asked, smiling gracefully. 
"Please do not be that guy." Hahaha...
"Let me buy you a drink, I insist you come with me." Will said.
"We have to drop by the pharmacy. You wouldn't like the burning sensation of your wounds."
"You'll have to stay longer then, I would love to be treated by you."
"I'm no nurse."
"I'm no patient."
"You're hurt."
"Oh damn it, just put the band aid, will ya?"
"Haha, yeah sure, I will, Will."
"If that's so, I'm so honored to be your patient... Miss?"
"Let's go get coffee." Vic left the conversation hanging while walking ahead of Will. Will smiled, knew that he loved her sense of humor. And somewhere in his heart, he wanted to know this girl more than he wanted to know any other girl. He tailed Vic and smiled.

                    Who would have thought, a coffee date would turn into a whole-day walk. It started off at a lamp post with an intention to put a band-aid on a slightly-wounded 6 feet tall man. Then the man bought you a drink and you got caffeine-drunk together. Then you got kind of hungry so you dropped by Bond 45 for a lunch treat. Summer in New York never felt better for Victoria.
Victoria went home, smiling while unlocking her door. The past few hours had been so wonderful. 
"You just bought a stranger a pizza. Do you always buy strangers food?" Vic asked Will when they were dining in Bond 45, finding themselves embraced in the heart of Times Square.
"Nope. I just want you tell me your name."
"And why does it bother you?"
"Because I wouldn't know what to call you."
"I guess it should be fine."
"Playing hard to get, huh?" Will teased, because he knew how pretty Vic looked when she blushed. And he did enjoy the scenery.
"Not my intention." Vic answered and they broke into laughter.
"Now that you're a complete stranger, I should tell you that my mother used to tell me that if I want someone to keep thinking about me, I should treat them food." 
"And why is that?"
"My mom said, they'll miss the person who buy them food." And so they laughed again.
Vic giggled to what happened a few hours back to when he spent her day with Will, talking about things that don't matter. Her right hand were on the wall while her ring finger switched on the lights. She smiled, twirled around, probably thinking that what she had before with Will was something more than just a one-day thing. Deep in her heart, she wanted to spend some more time with Will.
And now, she just had to admit that she really was thinking about Will.
Vic went into her bedroom, turned on the lights and starting to get herself out of her blouse. She took a look into the rectangular standing mirror located at the right corner of her room, the edges were bordered with small chained-lamp. SO tumblr-ish. She looked at the reflection of herself, it's been a long time since she smiled like this. Not that anything bad happened, it's just that life didn't came off as good as today. 
"No! I cannot fall for him. He's a complete stranger! No no no. This is so wrong! It's probably just the food." Vic told herself, didn't want to admit that she might have fallen in love with Will.
"I just met him today, I probably just fell for how he looked. I mean, there's not much I know about him. There's no way that I could like him. No no. Now baby, let's get you showered. You just need some home therapy." Vic assured herself. 
Vic grabbed her coral blue towel hung behind her door and put on her showering flip-flops. She got into her bathroom, painted white and tiled with some black mosaics in random formations. Her shower curtain was in matching coral blue. A small apartment, all designed to what she desires, enough to make her feel so safe and warm in the big, busy city.
 She turned of the hot shower and exhaled slowly. She let her mind wanders around the thoughts of Will. Even herself cannot tell what's the feeling.
While on the other fragment of the city of lights, Will was staring at a blank television screen, still in his suit on his red single couch. His feet were sat on his glass coffee table. His black leather shoes were in his right hand. He let out a sigh, and the shoes fell off his hand.
He let out a few breathes away before he decided to call it a day. 
Today was quite stressful for Will. He almost lost his job because he arrived slightly later for a company meeting and lost a few charts on the way there. He told the officers that he was willing to catch the subway to get those charts back but the clients declined and asked him to proceed to presenting. 
His representative who was supposed to prepare a speech on behalf of him failed to create a convincing one. All he served Will was the points for himself to elaborate spontaneously while presenting, which at the moment, Will failed to do so. At the end of the meeting, the clients did somehow agreed to the proposal but still, he complained to the boss about how the team were lacked of professionalism.
Summarized, Will was called to go face-to-face with the boss and was told that he failed to convince the clients. They only agreed to work because of the company's well-known reputation. And the client himself complained about Will. 
Buzzfeed was meant to comfort him for the rest of the day.  
The girl he met at the sidewalk, he didn't know. But he knew that he did had a burnt knee, a swollen forehead and a wounded palm. Hurting enough to distract himself from thinking about his work. He walked into his bedroom, and reached for a first-aid kit placed just beside his bathroom door. 
Time to heal these scars before it took over his charm.

                    "Tell me some random things, Will." Victoria breaks the silence. Will turned his head to Victoria and smiled. Vic is still drawn to the image of the beautiful dancing clouds above her head.
"Well, for starters, I love to drink coffees. My favorite childhood hobby was flying kite and believe it or not, I know how to sew really well." Will answered.
"Oh my god, what? You know how to sew? That was..."
"Amazing. I know." Will continues as we both let out a laugh
