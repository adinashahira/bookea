                     AN HOUR BEFORE
"I don't know what to say, Carol. I mean, you guys are like, 8 years apart. There's no way he has no girlfriend before he met you. Plus, you've only known him for a month. You don't even know what he's like. He could be a playboy." Lindsay said to me.
These few weeks, I couldn't keep my mind off Steven. He's my driving coach and I've only knew him for a few weeks. But then, the way he talked to me, laughed to my jokes and praised me at some points undeniably made my heart go all messed up. Of course, there's endless possibilities of him just being himself and not in any way flirting with me. But I believed in my instincts. I could be right. Me, thinking that he might be into me was one of the possibilities. 
"Lindsay, can't you see it? He has been flirting with me. I don't know but he was quite happy when his friends teased us. You know, a man could not be like that if he doesn't have a thing for a girl." I know I was being utterly defensive when I already know that I was walking on a fragile rope.
"Don't put your hopes too high babe, I don't want to see you get hurt." 
I know, there was a thin line between a yes, and a no. And as much as a 'yes' could make someone's life 100 times better, the ability of a 'no' to crash someone's life could be way worse. 
Sometimes, I'd like to sit down and wonder if this feeling only came to me because I was the one who actually fell head over heels for him. That's why the thought of him crushing on me has been taunting me so badly that I lose my appetite because I wanna be skinnier than before. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I'm not perfect and I didn't had a chance. 
But in time, my hopes grew bigger and it started to eat me up.
"I just want you to be sure about this, Carol. Have you thought about any bad circumstances that may happen?" Lindsay asked me for the thousandth time if I really wanted to go on a date with Steve.
My previous driving class was my last one before the driving test, and I was late so Steve had to handle me alone. Actually, I was late on purpose because I wanted to have him all for myself. If I had arrived earlier that day, I would have to wait for my turn while seeing other girls being in his service. I could not stand the fact that I would be jealous of them. 
So, at the end of my session, I reminded him about out last day together. And I teased him by telling him that I would love to watch a sunset with him. Well, discreetly.
"So, thank you, for the lessons. I'm afraid I wouldn't have the chance to say it to you later." I said to Steve.
"Nah, none of my students have ever thanked me before. I'm used to it. It doesn't matter that much tho." Said Steve.
"Well, I thought you could use a token of appreciation."
"What's the token for?"
"Well, there's a theme park for appreciation tokens."
"We shall go there then." Steve said and we laughed because clearly, it was a fun joke.
And there was a silence.
"You know what I've always wanted to do?" I broke the silence by talking shit. I knew that I shouldn't have get into something personal but, I did.
"No, you tell me." Steve answered. I was excited that he asked. But deep down, I know that it was just respect. It was just manners showing so I didn't seem desperate and eager of something that I wasn't sure about.
"I've always wanted to have a picnic by the beach."
"That's cool." He said, and yeah, he was just being nice.
 "You know what I've always wanted to do?"
"No, you tell me." 
"I want to watch a sunset with someone."
"I would be honored to be the one's beside you while the sun set."  
"Lindsay, I'm sure I'll be okay. It's not like I haven't been in this situation. I'm not going to be the first one to confess. I'll wait for him to say he likes me." I said as soon as I'm done looking back at our conversation yesterday.
"What if he don't?"
"Nothing will happen, okay. Do not worry about me. I'll be okay." I answered. Although somehow, I knew that I was hoping for him to tell me that he liked me. I just could not be true to anyone. This had became so complicated to me that I cannot be true to everyone, even my best friend.
"Carol, you did tell him lots of fake facts tho. I mean, you're not really that scared of dogs but he thinks you are. If this proceeds, then you'll have to keep pretending to be someone else that's not you." Lindsay finally said that one thing that matters the most in my situation now.
And all I could let out was a sigh. For that, I have no solution. I've made a big mistake by lying to him because I wanted to seem interesting, and now, I'm trapped in my own trap. There's nothing I could do that could change the fact that I lied. Even if there is, it will not end nicely.
And it didn't.
"Do you have anything to say about that?" Lindsay interrupted my delirium.
I knew I cannot shake my head. I honestly didn't have anything to say because I knew it's wrong. But I didn't know what to do either. If there was a list of miserable person, I would be on the Top 10. Someone who lied just to make their life seems better is a bad person because they could do better in their live and just tell nothing about it to anyone, if it's not worth a story.
But I chose the wrong path.
"To be honest, and before you misread my intentions, I want you to know that all I'm going to say is because I love you, and I don't want anything bad happen to you. Firstly, you have to know that you've started off with the wrong foot, and now you're pushing yourself more into the cliff when you have the chance to pull back, and restart. Your lies have been my concern because a lie, will not always be a lie. It will be a fire, and it will burn you until you're dead alive. And when the moment arrives, you cannot do anything anymore." Lindsay said.
Everything she said was true. So true that I started to feel like I'm burning slowly. Like I'm gonna vanish right away and I wish that my mind can control my emotions. My heart wanted to go see him because I believe that he had a thing on me. But my mind started to play with the logic to arbitrate my own decision. 
"Maybe I just have to know what'll happen so I won't do it next time." I told Lindsay as I stood up from the comfy bed in my bedroom. I walked to my cupboard and started to go through the clothes I have. I need to look my best today because at this point, all in my mind was that even if Steve didn't love me, I can make he like me if I dressed well. 
Sundresses were never my thing but if that's the price I'll have to pay for his love, I'll be willing to style it. I swear that now, it's not only Steve's impression that mattered. I want to prove to Lindsay that this love is not unrequited. 
"I hope that you can see that you're just obsessed and you're just dumb because he, is not like the other boys you've met before and you're just don't know anything!" Lindsay said as she stormed off my room angrily. There was a pink sundress that I laid off on my bed that I asked for her opinion earlier. It was my sundress, and she took it with her as she left me clueless.
I didn't have any idea why she would be mad and now, I didn't have my dress anymore.
I glanced at the round sea green clock held against the wall above my headrest and realized that I'm only left with half an hour to make sure that I looked good for the date. So bad that only at that moment I started to question myself if it was really a date. 
THE 'DATE'
I ARRIVED at the South Cove Park in a green sundress with little pink and orange flowers scattering around. It was a gift from my brother for the Valentine's Day last year. He said that her girlfriend, Victoria picked the dress because I told him that I had my first date with my ex-boyfriend, James. That dress impressed James and because of it, we lasted for over 8 months before he decided that he could not go through long-distance relationship as soon as he left New York for California.
Now, I'm wearing it because I believe that it could make things work like how it managed to connect James and I.
I read my watch and it was 4:30pm, 45 minutes away from New York sunset. At the moment, I didn't know if I was late or early because I didn't recall him telling me the exact hour that we should be here. Nothing's wrong if I wait so I decided to give him some time. He's working, he probably arrived a little late because he must had his clients that he must work for.
4:45pm : It's been fifteen minutes and still, no signs of him. We're approximately half an hour away from sunset and he's still not here. I looked around the park to see if he's anywhere around but then my mind reversed itself to a couple of days back to when he told me that he wanted to watch a sunset. I came up with 3 horrible facts;
1. He didn't tell me the time.
2. He didn't tell me the place.
3. "I would be honored to be the one's beside you while the sun set." --  nothing happened after this. Nothing.
Lindsay got one point, I'm dumb.
Out of my consciousness, I reached for my rose gold iPhone 6s and dialed his number. 
Another point for Lindsay, I'm obsessed.
As I was about to end my call, he picked up, and I got nervous, and I left it hanging...
Steve : Carol? What's up?
Carol : Are you seeing the sunset today?
Steve : No, why? 
Carol : Well, you should. You said you would. 
Steve : What?
Carol : You said you wanted to watch the sunset with someone. It'll be here in fifteen minutes so you better come find me at the South Cove. I'll buy you a hotdog. See ya there, Steve.
I said as I ended the conversation because I wouldn't want to hear what he had to say about my actions. Gosh, how I wish I could turn the clock and change the time. I should've never called him.
Time passes by, and now it's only 10 minutes away from the sunset. I lose hope. I give up. I know that all of these mess is totally dumb and I should've listened to Lindsay. There's no way he'd come. I'm just a student and he's just a teacher. He's just trying to be friendly and he was never flirting with me. He's years older and he might have been engaged to someone. My hopes, were going nowhere and suddenly, it all fades away. 
I didn't know what to feel. I felt stupid and ashamed. I felt like I have been a fool.
5:18pm
"Well, the sun's gonna set whether you have to see it alone, or with someone." I heard a voice from my back and as I turned around, Steve was there.
I was stunned. He's finally here. He's there, right beside me, standing tall with his hands in his washed jeans pocket. He smiled to the sun set and he looked like he's grateful to be here, with me.
"Steve... I..." 
"Shh. We shall wait until the sun sets." He said, cutting my words. 
We both sat on the bench, facing the golden red sky as the sun slowly descends itself from the above. We watched the sun set together and it was one hell of a scenery.
"Steve... I..." I tried to speak when the night sky started to adorn the world.
"No, Coral, listen..."
"My name's Carol." I sighed, corrected him. I felt stupid. He didn't even know my name. Now, it's guaranteed, I've been singing alone and he was never playing the music. 
"Sorry, Carol. Carol, I'm sorry that you have to wait for me but I seriously didn't ring a bell about today. You know, works and stuffs. I couldn't recall having this date with you."
He said that it was a date. "No, Steve. I was wrong. We never set a date. I'm sorry."
...
"No, don't feel bad. I shouldn't have stopped there when you said that you wanted to watch the sunset with me. I should have told you that I wanted to watch it with someone special. And there's no way nice to say it but you're not her. She's actually waiting for me at the Central Park. But I decided that if I were gonna say it, the best way is to say it here. The worst thing a man can do is break a heart through a phone call. I'm sorry that it's this way." Steve said. 
I felt tears rolling down my cheek. This is awful. This is bad. This is stupid. I am stupid. Lindsay won another fair point, I know nothing.
Now it's 0-3, and the game's already over.
"Carol, I'm really sorry but you're too young for me. And you have a long way ahead of you..."
"I'm starting to feel like I love you..." I cut him out. And as dumb as it can be, I don't know why I just said that. Now I'm getting dumber and dumber. I'm the dumbest.
"Oh no, no Carol. You shouldn't. I am so not the man for you. I mean, you're nice and all but I've found the girl and I'm gonna marry her next week. I don't know what I'd do to make you feel like this but believe me, I didn't intend to toy with your heart in any way, I promise. I'd treat you fairly like how I treat the rest of my students. I'm sorry..."
I kept on crying because it hurts. It hurts so much. And I felt like I was burning in flames, about to turn into ashes. My cheeks turned red of embarrassment, my hands shaking of sadness and my heart beat like I'm dying. And there came the worst part, it's like Lindsay had spoken to God and saw that everything about the date would go wrong. A chihuahua came near me and tried to comfort me by rubbing itself against my leg. Of course, at this moment of breaking down, I didn't recall my fake personality. I forgot how much I'm scared of dogs.
"Talking about pets, I once had a bulldog and he was so aggressive to strangers. So one day, when I had my friend came over for a tea-time, I asked Lilo, my bulldog to tease her because she's scared of dogs. So Lilo did, and only God knew how loud she was. It was funny." Steve told a story about a girl who made me jealous.  
"You know what Steve? I hate dogs. And I'm so scared of them. If I ever see one, I would run like Usain Bolt and scream like I've just watched a horror movie. And I hate horror movies too." I said to Steve while practicing a U-Turn.
"And now, the chihuahua's are making you feel better." Steve said while he let out a small laugh, probably realizing that I lied to him.
I didn't know what to do. Things became crazier and crazier from minute to minute. Whose chihuahua was messing around with me at this very moment?! God better... God better thank you for making the date an awful moment of my life because if it didn't fail, I wouldn't have met a better man.
"You know what, Carol, Sheena's my girlfriend, and she's once afraid of dogs but she became closer to Lilo. Now she's not scared anymore. I don't know if that's the case with you but if it isn't, I have something to say." Steve said as he put his arms around me and pat my back, with care and support.
"You are pretty, and you are so nice. But I am a man, and you probably lied to me about who you are. I don't know why but I'm guessing that you wanted me to like you. The possibilities are because you don't know that I have Sheena. You see, I want to tell you that sometimes men tend to be friendly with girls but it doesn't always mean that they want to flirt with you. Because if they wanted to, they would've made the first step. That's the gentlemen way of picking up dates. You shouldn't keep your hopes high because what's important is that you love yourself more than you love someone else. Don't let yourself get hurt, like this. Now, not only that you claimed a new identity and pretend to be someone else, but you also made me feel guilty of letting you down. But if I don't say it today, then you'll probably keep on hoping on things that wasn't going to be an event in your life. You have to move on. Now, it would be super awkward for me to see you again because I feel guilty. Please, prioritize yourself, Carol. Don't put me, don't put Lindsay or anyone ahead of yourself, okay?" Steve continued. 
As much as I hated his honesty, his words are the truest and I don't have any other options on what should he say to me. He better be honest, it's the best for both of us. But...
"How'd you know Lindsay?" I asked him.
"Well, she's just being a good friend. When she saw me at the Central Park with Sheena earlier, she told me that you'd be waiting but I don't believe in her. But then she told me, if I'd ever decide to see you today, she wanted me to be honest with you. She's here, waiting for me to leave you because she wanted to be there when you need her. Like now. So, I hope you'll be fine. I'm sorry. So sorry. I have to go, Carol." Steve explained as he pat on my head and left me slowly there. 
I can hear his footsteps as he fade away from my life. It was a disaster. I've learned a lot in just one sunset. I got hurt, and punished at the same time. But at least, I see how badly I've let myself go wrong. So from now on, I never wanted to do this to myself again.
"Cry, let it all out now and don't bring him home." Lindsay said as she sat beside me and pat my back. I rest my head on her bare shoulder and cry. 
..."I'm sorry, this is my chihuahua. I'm sorry he just ran out. The collar broke." A man said as he's catching his breath, probably because he ran after his chihuahua.
We nodded, my eyes were all swollen of crying. I stood up, giving a sign to Lindsay that I wanted to go home. It's time to rest. It had been a long day.
As we were ready to leave the park... "I know I'm a stranger but, can I give you a hug? It seems like you kinda need one." The man said to me and opened his arm, ready to have me in his embrace.
I hesitated, but I was broke. I stepped closer to him, and let myself fall into his arms.
"My name's Ed. Now, I'm not a stranger. Whatever happens to you, miss, I hope you'll be fine. Life gets better. This sadness may be a starting point to your new exciting life later. I believe. You should believe." He continued.
And I smiled, what a beautiful ending to a horrible love story.
THE END (:
