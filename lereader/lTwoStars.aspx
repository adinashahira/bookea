            <h1> New Life After The Win </h1>
            <p class="content"> It has been a week since the previous cycle of America's Next Top Model ended and Darlene Peterson is sleeping soundly on the couch in the middle of her living room. The apartment she's living in is her home sweet home. Then, she was only just a girl obsessed to modelling, runways and Tyra Banks of course. All those nights she slept only to dream about herself being shot in pretty sceneries and wearing haute coutures by Yu Tsai or Erik Asla and maybe if she's lucky enough, she'll have her photo being the best in an episode or win a challenge and finally cuddle up with a hot guy model in the Tyra Suite.

But today, she's sleeping on that couch as a proud America's Next Top Model. Not just a contestant; she's tried on that sponsored TRNGLE bikini set and has kissed tons of male models for best photos. She's the winner of the previous cycle. The last girl standing for the finale alongside the so hot, so sexy Arthur Clark and Jeffery Wilson. Darlene Peterson, will soon be appearing on Guess ad campaigns, will be spreading with pride on NYLON magazine and is ready to divert the world attention to her. She's ready for whatever chances that will be up for her taking.

Darlene Peterson is now the America's Next Top Model.

As Darlene was sleeping soundly on the couch at 3 in the morning because she was just so exhausted from the afterparty last night, her phone decided to ring. At this peak moment of life, Darlene couldn't decline any-- or maybe even shouldn't decline ANY phone calls because every single one might lay out a new opportunity for her. Job offers, modelling contracts, photoshoots, red carpet walk, runway show or even a date. Everything is possible now since she's the star. Everyone wants to walk around with Darlene Peterson now. She was already the pleasing one since her days in the New York City. But now, she is the eye candy of the Hollywood.

The fact that the phone call might decide her next path in the fameway wakes Darlene up for her sound sleep.

"This better be good." Says her as she accepted the phone call.

"Knock, knock!" The voice at the end of the line greets her, hoping for an exciting answer.

"Who's there? It's like 5 in the morning." That's all that Darlene is thinking because who's to lie, she's so damn tired of last night. All the drinking and dancing knocked her out of her conciousness. She can't even tell if she even kissed someone last night because just suddenly, there's a pack of cigarettes on her soft wooden floor, just inches away from where her fluffy blue carpet lies.

"Darlene, pick yourself up! It's only 5! I'm Daniel, by the way. I'm going to manage your career in and out all the way to reach the peak of the fame mountain!" Well, looks like Dan is way more excited than Darlene when it should be her, getting all pumped up to finally be managed by someone calibered in this platform.

"Finally, you called. I have been waiting since Rodney told me that I would be assigned to manager." Darlene responds to him, at last, sounding a little cherished by the phone call.

"I'm sorry I kind of bad in managing my time. There's party here and there, Rihanna comes by to a club. I'm not gonna miss all that stuff. But now, I'm ready to be here for you, Darlene."

"Well, thanks. I can't wait to work with you."

"Me too! Well first thing, I want to apologize for waking you up at this hour. You must be exhausted!" Dan tries to build up conversation with Darlene, to pick up her mood before he sends out a very sensational news to her.

"I can tell that I'm already worn out now. I don't even know where is the lights. I was just home a few minutes ago. But it's okay. Is there anything that I need to know?" Darlene explains her exhaustion to Dan, probably wanting for the conversation to go in a faster pace since she's already eating herself out.

"Okay, sorry again. I really want you to get some rest so for tomorrow, I've had your schedule arranged. I've cleared up all activities for tomorrow, postponed them to 4pm so your appearance to the ANTM Booch and Tooch will only be expected at 4:30pm. No worries I got it handled. Sharply at 2, you stylist will be at your apartment to don you if that's fine. Then the latest you'll be home for your beauty rest is at 9pm, arranged as well. If you need spa facilities, they'll be available from that hour to 11pm so just ring me if you'd be expecting one." Dan explains to Darlene of her next day schedule that will start a few hours later than the original schedule.

"Wow, that's great Dan. Thanks for setting them up nicely for me. I'm glad to have you. I was worried sick about if I was able to be at the event at noon." Darlene thanks Dan for his generous effort.

"No problems. You don't have to worry about Tyra or your fans, I've got it all done. Explained, crystal clear. Get some rest, babygirl. You've had enough energy poured out last night at the carnivale, people already loves you!" Honest praises from the pretty heart, Dan.

"Thank you so much, anything else?"

"Oh, and one more thing, Darlene."

"Yes?"

"I might have landed you an audition for Tom Deller's newest movie, but I haven't promised anything. Honestly, I'd like you to try for it."

"Oh my, are you serious? But I'm a model, not an actor!"

"There's so much drama they seen on ANTM. Enough for them to let me place your name amongst other stars for the audition. They said me about giving you a shot. Darlene, this is gonna be your big break. Think about it, okay?" Dan explains to Darlene about how he really wants Darlene to work out her dreams.

"I'd have to think about it."

"Yes, take your time. Just tell me if you're interested. At least, try for the audition okay?"

"Who are you, exactly, Dan? To get me landed on a big production audition. You are not just one of the 'managers' right?" Darlene starts to wonder if it's just her luck to have someone so big managing her because to have her name in for a tryout for a Tom Deller's movie is surely not common.

"I'm Daniel Roberts. You sure know who I am." Dan answers her.

Daniel Roberts, not a foreign name in the industry. She knows him, even if the only place he's working at is backstage. He has been managing tons of celebrities and his power is up to a point when he gets to decide if he's already bored working with someone. He moves on to one famous artist to another like a frog hopping on from one lily to another in a fresh pond. He is the son of the famous director, Jin Roberts that now owns one of the biggest cinematic company in all America, and to Ariel Roberts, one of the hotest film producer of all time. He is born with the managin skills, being able to get into every single event with respect. Did I mention that he is young? He's only 27.

Daniel Roberts used to manage tons of stars before he decided to place hands on many ANTM contestants who wants to be a movie star. He succeeded to introduce the world to many of new actors coming from that very show, widening their chances from just being a model, to being a superstar. He has power over a bucket of directors and producers to have his clients placed on their cast list and he is for sure bold enough to tell every single one of them if they are not good enough to be managed by him. The only one, Daniel Roberts.

He's soon gonna own the Hollywood path to fame. And Darlene has no idea why she deserved Dan. Dan as in Daniel Roberts.

"Shit. What did I do to deserve you, Dan?"

"You did nothing but you sure got a lot of things to do. Make sure you shine the brightest among all, okay? We have two reputations to keep, yours and mine. I'll climb with you so we'll be together at the top, okay?" Dan gets in the mood of making sure Darlene is work-ready and is worth for his effort.

"For sure not gonna waste your hardships, Mr. Roberts."

"Well, that's my girl. Go get your beauty sleep back. See you in the limelight." Dan ends the phone call.

Darlene now has no worries over her sleep. She knows that tomorrow, she'll be one hell of star with the best manager any superstar could ever wish for. And maybe tomorrow she can finally be ready to burst out as a movie star. Let her name rolls in the credits. Darlene Peterson as Someone in a Big Hollywood movie as directed by the famous Tom Deller. Perfect layout.



THE NEXT DAY, 2 HOURS BEFORE THE ANTM TOOCH AND BOOCH EVENT

Ring, Ring! The sound of the doorbell. Darlene is in her pink furry t-shirt with a black legging, watching some of Law and Order. Just in time, waiting for the make-up team to show up and doll her up for her first ANTM event, after the show ended. It will be her first official meet and greet with her fans that have been voting her on the net until she was crowned as the winner just a week ago. She's now ready to meet some of her past colleagues from the cycle, and her in-show frenemy of course, Akili Faraji.

Akili and her were never good match in the house. Akili is from the Africa and that's okay until she brags round and round about how she is the odd one out in the house. As if nobody else could be more unique than her. For Darlene, it's okay to be proud of your homeland, and showing yourself in the brand but when you had been absorbed too much into thinking that you deserve a win just because you are not American, you are killing everyone's mood.

Darlene remembers that one day when they were paired up for a photoshoot for the 5th episode, Tyra gave the whole rights to dress themselves up according to their own 'branding'. At first, everything was fine. Then Akili tried to take over the whole wardrobe by pointing here and there, saying how lack of African native culture is available to pick from the closet. Then she decided to fuse the American style with African but everything ended up looking too much African. During the judging, the judges said that Darlene failed to make a brand for herself that she's stuck up being just an accessory for the shoot. That was her biggest failure; sparked up a fire between Akili and her.

Ring, Ring! The doorbell has to ring again since Darlene seems to not be moving from her comfy seat. Well, there are two distractions there. Netflix, and her reminiscing about her old days with that one brat, Akili Faraji.

"I'm coming!" Darlene shouts from inside the house while walking to the door, ready to welcome her stylist. As she walks in front of a vertical mirror hanging on the wall a few centimetres away from the door, she makes sure that she looks just fine and not too tired from her lack of sleep. Once she reaches for the knob, she inhales. This is her first time dealing with a professional stylist-- well at least that's what she hopes from Dan Roberts.

"Hello Darling!" Dan exclaims as Darlene opens up a world of opportunity for him. There, in front of him stood this one star that will soon help him rebuild his career after a while being off track as a potential celebrity manager. He claims that the previous models were so indulged in the new celebrity lifestyle that they fell off their original plan.

"I'm so excited to see you in person, Darlene! I'm so glad I could manage you. Here I bring Jenna, your personal stylist starting from today onwards. She's been styling a lot of people and she also owns her own clothing line. This one I'm fabulously wearing, is in her new collection and you're be wearing one of hers too. Jenna brings along her make-up team too, the Naked pallette professionals. You'll be perfectly stunning this evening. Trust me." Dan explains his presence and the team he brought along.

"Thank you so much Dan. I would've never pictured myself being here today. Thank you so much. Are you gonna stay?" Darlene asks.

"I would love to so that I could get to know just a little bit more about you. I'll be also explaining my plans on your career and of course, to sell you out for the industry. Are you gonna be okay with that?"

"Sure, come in. I made pancakes." Darlene welcomes everyone into her apartment as she stands at the side of the door to make room for everyone and everything. There's hair equipment, bags of clothes and make-up toolbox. Dan steps in afterwards, looking super hot in a striped shirt with black silky pants. Very hot. Like a real man. Dan opens up his arms to offer Darlene a friendly hug.

"Aww, it's so nice to finally meet you, Dan." Darlene greets him.

As the embrace loosen, Darlene gives a brief tour of her apartment to the crew so it'll be easier for them to move around and reach for things.

"Have a seat, Darlene." Jenna says as she is ready to put some make-up on the pretty face of Darlene Peterson.

Darlene seats down, comfy in a make-up stool prepared by the team. She is amazed once Jenna opens up her make-up toolbox that contains tons of Naked pallette to die for. Then she looks around to see the crew opening up the black bags of nice dresses from Jenna's collection.

"It's for the sweet and soothing eye-candy like you, Darlene. Later we'll pick one for you." Jenna says, as she applies the very soft and perfect complexion of foundation on Darlene.

"Jenna's sponsoring the dress for you, all of them. You'll be seling them too, is it alright with you?" Dan asks Darlene if she is okay to campaign the sponsored dresses.

"I'm sure cool with that, I'm born for it, remember?" Darlene replies and they all laugh in agreement.

"Have you been thinking about the casting, Darlene? Just to let you know, and maybe to bribe you a little into going for the audition, Arnold Bennett was just casted as the main lead. And what you're casting for, is his heroine. If you're off for it, I can make it to your schedule for you tomorrow at 2pm." Dan tells the thing that somehow is attractive to Darlene.

ARNOLD BENNETT?! Are you freaking serious?! Arnold Bennett is one of the best actors in town, in line with Ashton Kutcher and Josh Hutcherson and Austin Butler and OH MY GOD she is offered for a land hand in hand with him!

"Darlene, what you say about it?"

...but Darlene is now in too deep for the thoughts of her, being Arnold's co-star. First, a movie deal. What's more? With Arnold Bennett?!
